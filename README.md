# just-for-fun

Just improvising on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Each time you click it gets more annoyed!

It just contains a user input, a button and a bit of CSS animation... just because!

#### Features

- **HTML**: For the structure.
- **CSS**: External CSS document and styling through JavaScript.
- **JavaScript**: For DOM manipulation and updating the UI dynamically.
